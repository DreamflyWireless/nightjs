* Put a single semicolon _before_ statements that start with `(` , `[` , `+` , `-` , `/`
  (see above article as for why it's needed)
* Start with comma per line when useing one `var` to declare mutiple variables at mutiple lines
* 65 charactors per line at most
* Remove any trailing whitespace from the end of lines
* Add one more blank line at the end of files
* `function name(){ }` for named functions
* `function(){ }` for anonymous functions
* No curly braces for single-line control flow statements such as `if` & friends
* Use long, descriptive variable and method names
* Use blank lines to separate "paragraphs" of code for readability
* Use comments to describe non-obvious code behavior
